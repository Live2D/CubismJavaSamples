# Notice
## [Restrictions] About the high-definition mask function (2022-10-06)
Cubism 4 SDK for Java R1 alpha1 does not support [switching to the high-definition method for processing masks](https://docs.live2d.com/en/cubism-sdk-manual/ow-sdk-mask-premake/#:~:text=Switch%20to%20a%20high%2Ddefinition%20method%20for%20processing%20masks).

Please note that using the `CubismRendererAndroid.isUsingHighPrecisionMask()` method will not change the model.

This support is scheduled for the alpha version or later.
